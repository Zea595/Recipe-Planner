# My Personal Project

## Weekly Recipe Planner

***Answers to task 2:***
- The application will plan out what to cook for each day of the upcoming week on a weekly basis
and randomly generate a shopping checklist for the plan.
- This application will primarily be used by people who cook on a routinely basis.
- I am a picky eater and oftentimes find myself short of some inspiration for what food I want to cook in the upcoming week when
doing grocery shopping at the supermarket. This often results in me lacking ingredients to cook what I want to
and forcing me to make an extra shopping run, wasting time in the process. I hope to get an idea of how to optimize 
my shopping runs through making this program.

***Task 3:***
- As a user, I want to be able to repeatedly generate a new weekly cooking plan that is suited to my tastes.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit and save the recipes I add.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit the recipe/plan for each day of the week.
- As a user, I want to be able to check off items off my shopping checklist.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose how to sort my checklist.

## Phase 2

***2 New User Stories***

- User should have the ability to save the planned week and the recipes.
- User should have the ability to load the weeks they save and the recipes.


## Phase 4

***Task 2:***
- Class MainFrame extends JFrame
- ActionListener thread run() overrides superclass run() method

***Task 3:***
-If I were to refactor my program, I would make everything less dependent on WeekPanel having
instance fields for everything and make each panel class more independent.
